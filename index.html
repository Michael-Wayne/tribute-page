                    women, and young Black women, just making sure that we put our country on the map...
                    A lot of our athletes are coming from nothing. We have to sacrifice so much to represent our
                    country, to show other young girls that it doesn't matter if we don't have the fancy stadium or the
                    fancy tracks that everybody else trains on. We can achieve greatness right here. Right at home."
